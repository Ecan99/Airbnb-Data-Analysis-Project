# Airbnb-Data-Analysis-Project ![Dashboard](Review.png)
This project analyzes Airbnb listing performance using Tableau Public. The focus was on understanding pricing trends, revenue patterns, and geographic distribution of listings.

## 📈 Project Highlights 
- Imported Airbnb datasets and performed an **inner join** between Listings and Calendar tables using `listing_id`.
- Built a **Bar Chart (Price by Zipcode)** to compare average prices across different areas.
- Designed a **Map Visualization (Price per Zipcode)** to show geographic distribution of pricing.
- Created a **Line Chart (Revenue per Year)** to track seasonal revenue trends.
- Developed a **Bar Chart (Average Price per Bedroom)** to analyze how prices scale with property size.
- Added a **Distinct Count of Bedrooms** chart to show listing distribution by property size.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated 
- **Tableau Public** for interactive dashboards.
- **Data Cleaning & Joining** (Listings + Calendar).
- **Visualization Techniques**: bar charts, line graphs, maps.
- **Analytical Thinking**: identifying trends and performance metrics.
